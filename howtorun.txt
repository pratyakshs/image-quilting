Quilting
--------

Call the function `loop_over_items` with parameters:
	* Input image (3D array for RGB)
	* Max size of patches to be considered (eg. [512 512])
	* Max left and top overlaps between patches (eg. [64 64])
	* Output image size (eg. [2048 2048])



Texture transfer
----------------

Call the function `synthesize` with parameters:
	* Input image texture (3D array for RGB)
	* Input target image (3D array for RGB)
	* A list of alpha parameters (eg. [0.1 0.5 0.9], usually in increasing order
	  and between 0 and 1)
	* Max size of patches to be considered (eg. [512 512])
	* Max left and top overlaps between patches (eg. [64 64])
	* Factor used to reduce size of image in each iteration (eg. 3)
	* Number of iterations (eg. 3)
